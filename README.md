# TriSVG
Create bright SVG backgrounds, click by click, triangle by triangle!

Instructions:
1. Click any triangle to further split it apart.
2. Save your background locally by pressing the "Enter" key.
3. Continue clicking away... or restart!

Further usage:

Edit the used hexadecimal colors to get different themes. Add as many as you like!

Edit the amount of variation allowed for each RGB component to better control the outcome. 

A fun side project, still in development!
